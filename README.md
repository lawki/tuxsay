 Mimicking cowsay in more Linux'y way !
#Why another cowsay
 Out of curiousity and to know what goes on while developing such an application.The project seems pretty simple at first sight,but the more you think about features,the harder it gets to handle the complexity.
 Also I find implementation of such software pretty cumbersome(though its engaging to read the source code),so I wrote this from scratch and I am pretty OK with the result as I was able to do it in about 3 hours.That's probably why it is not so feature rich.
 But I hope to enhance it to show the messages in more intuituve way.
